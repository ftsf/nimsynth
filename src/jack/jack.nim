## # 
## #  <b>IMPORTANT: Most JACK clients do NOT need to register a latency
## #  callback.</b>
## # 
## #  Clients that meet any of the following conditions do NOT
## #  need to register a latency callback:
## # 
## #     - have only input ports
## #     - have only output ports
## #     - their output is totally unrelated to their input
## #     - their output is not delayed relative to their input
## #         (i.e. data that arrives in a given process()
## #          callback is processed and output again in the
## #          same callback)
## # 
## #  Clients NOT registering a latency callback MUST also
## #  satisfy this condition:
## # 
## #     - have no multiple distinct internal signal pathways
## # 
## #  This means that if your client has more than 1 input and
## #  output port, and considers them always "correlated"
## #  (e.g. as a stereo pair), then there is only 1 (e.g. stereo)
## #  signal pathway through the client. This would be true,
## #  for example, of a stereo FX rack client that has a
## #  left/right input pair and a left/right output pair.
## # 
## #  However, this is somewhat a matter of perspective. The
## #  same FX rack client could be connected so that its
## #  two input ports were connected to entirely separate
## #  sources. Under these conditions, the fact that the client
## #  does not register a latency callback MAY result
## #  in port latency values being incorrect.
## # 
## #  Clients that do not meet any of those conditions SHOULD
## #  register a latency callback.
## # 
## #  See the documentation for  @ref jack_port_set_latency_range()
## #  on how the callback should operate. Remember that the @a mode

## #  @defgroup LatencyFunctions Managing and determining latency
## # 
## #  The purpose of JACK's latency API is to allow clients to
## #  easily answer two questions:
## # 
## #  - How long has it been since the data read from a port arrived
## #    at the edge of the JACK graph (either via a physical port
## #    or being synthesized from scratch)?
## # 
## #  - How long will it be before the data written to a port arrives
## #    at the edge of a JACK graph?
## #
## #  To help answering these two questions, all JACK ports have two
## #  latency values associated with them, both measured in frames:
## # 
## #  <b>capture latency</b>: how long since the data read from
## #                   the buffer of a port arrived at
## #                   a port marked with JackPortIsTerminal.
## #                   The data will have come from the "outside
## #                   world" if the terminal port is also
## #                   marked with JackPortIsPhysical, or
## #                   will have been synthesized by the client
## #                   that owns the terminal port.
## # 
## #  <b>playback latency</b>: how long until the data
## #                    written to the buffer of port will reach a port
## #                    marked with JackPortIsTerminal.
## # 
## #  Both latencies might potentially have more than one value
## #  because there may be multiple pathways to/from a given port
## #  and a terminal port. Latency is therefore generally
## #  expressed a min/max pair.
## # 
## #  In most common setups, the minimum and maximum latency
## #  are the same, but this design accomodates more complex
## #  routing, and allows applications (and thus users) to
## #  detect cases where routing is creating an anomalous
## #  situation that may either need fixing or more
## #  sophisticated handling by clients that care about
## #  latency.
## # 
## #  See also @ref jack_set_latency_callback for details on how
## #  clients that add latency to the signal path should interact
## #  with JACK to ensure that the correct latency figures are
## #  used.
## #  @{
## # 
## #*
## #  The port latency is zero by default. Clients that control
## #  physical hardware with non-zero latency should call this
## #  to set the latency to its correct value. Note that the value
## #  should include any systemic latency present "outside" the
## #  physical hardware controlled by the client. For example,
## #  for a client controlling a digital audio interface connected
## #  to an external digital converter, the latency setting should
## #  include both buffering by the audio interface *and* the converter.
## # 
## #  @deprecated This method will be removed in the next major
## #  release of JACK. It should not be used in new code, and should
## #  be replaced by a latency callback that calls @ref
## #  jack_port_set_latency_range().

proc jack_port_set_latency*(port: ptr JackPort, a3: jack_nframes) {.importc.}
## #*
## #  return the latency range defined by @a mode for
## #  @a port, in frames.
## # 
## #  See @ref LatencyFunctions for the definition of each latency value.
## # 
## #  This is normally used in the LatencyCallback.
## #  and therefor safe to execute from callbacks.
## # 

proc jack_port_get_latency_range*(port: ptr JackPort, mode: jack_latency_callback_mode, range: ptr jack_latency_range) {.importc.}
## #*
## #  set the minimum and maximum latencies defined by
## #  @a mode for @a port, in frames.
## # 
## #  See @ref LatencyFunctions for the definition of each latency value.
## # 
## #  This function should ONLY be used inside a latency
## #  callback. The client should determine the current
## #  value of the latency using @ref jack_port_get_latency_range()
## #  (called using the same mode as @a mode)
## #  and then add some number of frames to that reflects
## #  latency added by the client.
## # 
## #  How much latency a client adds will vary
## #  dramatically. For most clients, the answer is zero
## #  and there is no reason for them to register a latency
## #  callback and thus they should never call this
## #  function.
## # 
## #  More complex clients that take an input signal,
## #  transform it in some way and output the result but
## #  not during the same process() callback will
## #  generally know a single constant value to add
## #  to the value returned by @ref jack_port_get_latency_range().
## # 
## #  Such clients would register a latency callback (see
## #  @ref jack_set_latency_callback) and must know what input
## #  ports feed which output ports as part of their
## #  internal state. Their latency callback will update
## #  the ports' latency values appropriately.
## # 
## #  A pseudo-code example will help. The @a mode argument to the latency
## #  callback will determine whether playback or capture
## #  latency is being set. The callback will use
## #  @ref jack_port_set_latency_range() as follows:
## # 
## #  \code
## #  jack_latency_range range;
## #  if (mode == JackPlaybackLatency) {
## #   foreach input_port in (all self-registered port) {
## #    jack_port_get_latency_range (port_feeding_input_port, JackPlaybackLatency, &range);
## #    range.min += min_delay_added_as_signal_flows_from port_feeding to input_port;
## #    range.max += max_delay_added_as_signal_flows_from port_feeding to input_port;
## #    jack_port_set_latency_range (input_port, JackPlaybackLatency, &range);
## #   }
## #  } else if (mode == JackCaptureLatency) {
## #   foreach output_port in (all self-registered port) {
## #    jack_port_get_latency_range (port_fed_by_output_port, JackCaptureLatency, &range);
## #    range.min += min_delay_added_as_signal_flows_from_output_port_to_fed_by_port;
## #    range.max += max_delay_added_as_signal_flows_from_output_port_to_fed_by_port;
## #    jack_port_set_latency_range (output_port, JackCaptureLatency, &range);
## #   }
## #  }
## #  \endcode
## # 
## #  In this relatively simple pseudo-code example, it is assumed that
## #  each input port or output is connected to only 1 output or input
## #  port respectively.
## # 
## #  If a port is connected to more than 1 other port, then the

## #  The absolute value of frame times is meaningless, frame times have meaning
## #  only relative to each other.

## #  server began the current process cycle.
## # 

proc jack_frames_since_cycle_start*(a2: ptr JackClient): jack_nframes {.importc.}
## #*
## #  @return the estimated current time in frames.
## #  This function is intended for use in other threads (not the process
## #  callback).  The return value can be compared with the value of
## #  jack_last_frame_time to relate time in other threads to JACK time.
## # 

proc jack_frame_time*(a2: ptr JackClient): jack_nframes {.importc.}
## #*
## #  @return the precise time at the start of the current process cycle.
## #  This function may only be used from the process callback, and can
## #  be used to interpret timestamps generated by jack_frame_time() in
## #  other threads with respect to the current process cycle.
## # 
## #  This is the only jack time function that returns exact time:
## #  when used during the process callback it always returns the same
## #  value (until the next process callback, where it will return
## #  that value + nframes, etc).  The return value is guaranteed to be
## #  monotonic and linear in this fashion unless an xrun occurs.
## #  If an xrun occurs, clients must check this value again, as time
## #  may have advanced in a non-linear way (e.g. cycles may have been skipped).
## # 

proc jack_last_frame_time*(client: ptr JackClient): jack_nframes {.importc.}
## #*
## #  This function may only be used from the process callback.
## #  It provides the internal cycle timing information as used by
## #  most of the other time related functions. This allows the
## #  caller to map between frame counts and microseconds with full
## #  precision (i.e. without rounding frame times to integers),
## #  and also provides e.g. the microseconds time of the start of
## #  the current cycle directly (it has to be computed otherwise).
## # 
## #  If the return value is zero, the following information is
## #  provided in the variables pointed to by the arguments:
## # 
## #  current_frames: the frame time counter at the start of the
## #                  current cycle, same as jack_last_frame_time().
## #  current_usecs:  the microseconds time at the start of the
## #                  current cycle.
## #  next_usecs:     the microseconds time of the start of the next
## #                  next cycle as computed by the DLL.
## #  period_usecs:   the current best estimate of the period time in
## #                   microseconds.
## # 
## #  NOTES:
## #  
## #  Because of the types used, all the returned values except period_usecs
## #  are unsigned. In computations mapping between frames and microseconds
## #  *signed* differences are required. The easiest way is to compute those
## #  separately and assign them to the appropriate signed variables,
## #  int32 for frames and int64 for usecs. See the implementation of
## #  jack_frames_to_time() and Jack_time_to_frames() for an example.
## #  
## #  Unless there was an xrun, skipped cycles, or the current cycle is the
## #  first after freewheeling or starting Jack, the value of current_usecs
## #  will always be the value of next_usecs of the previous cycle.
## # 
## #  The value of period_usecs will in general NOT be exactly equal to
## #  the difference of next_usecs and current_usecs. This is because to
## #  ensure stability of the DLL and continuity of the mapping, a fraction
## #  of the loop error must be included in next_usecs. For an accurate
## #  mapping between frames and microseconds, the difference of next_usecs
## #  and current_usecs should be used, and not period_usecs.
## # 
## #  @return zero if OK, non-zero otherwise.
